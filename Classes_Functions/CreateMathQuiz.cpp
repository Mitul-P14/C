    6 questions total
    Of the 6 questions:
        3 questions use random numbers
        1 question uses pow
        2 questions must use rounding - 1 that does round to whole number and 1 that does roundf to 2 decimal places
    After they type in their answer to a question tell them if they are right or wrong.
    Example:  You got it right!  It was 3                     or                  Sorry you got it wrong. The answer was 3
